# Weather-Recognition
-Weather Recognition is an application of Deep learning in which we can detect weather of the image provided by using CNN(convulational neural networks) in python(keras)
-The model classify the weather into 5 categories(cloudy, foggy,rainy, shine and sunrise)
-I used kaggle api to get the data.
-I didn't use any pretrained model instead build mysel using keras library.
